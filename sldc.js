// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Figure out what the application is supossed to do and the requirments it will have. Define the recources you will need to build the application."

const design = "Models the way an application will work. Create the frame and all the aspects your project will need."

const testingAndIntegration = "Ensures that each function will work correctly. Ensures each part of the function will work together as you need it to. This reduces the amount of bugs you may have in the code."

const implementation = "The application is open to the users! Testing is complete and the app will be used by people outside of its engineers"

const maintain = "Developers now fix any bugs that the users find in the finished application. Errors found in the program will need to be resolved."
